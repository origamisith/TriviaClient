# Trivia Application Client
This is the client code for my trivia application. I started planning this project in 2021, finished most of the plannign in 2022, and am picking it up again to hopefully get a prototype running this year. This frontend will be written in React and make use of WebSockets in-game to provide a live connection to the server.
